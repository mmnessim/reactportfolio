            <p>Welcome to an in-development web portfolio written in React.js. I intend for this website to be an place to display and test some of the things that I've been learning. At the moment, I am just filling out the basic structure of the page, such as the different sections, content, and functionality. Don't be surprised if things look wonky, or if something is broken. Almost everything at this point is a placeholder, including the color scheme and styling.</p>
            <p>All that being said, welcome and feel free to poke around. I'm hoping to make this a more inviting page soon!</p>
        </div>
